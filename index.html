        <p><em>Pharmacy Assistant, Fitness Instructor and <strong>Student</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>Hi, and Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find my CV, life parcour, and other things I haven't worked out yet.
          <em>But for now, bear with me as I try not to be <strong>nauseatingly</strong> predictible and boring as I tell you a little bit about myself</em>.</p>
      </td>

  <p>I am a <strong>strong</strong> believer that we should be really <em>enjoying</em> how we chose to spend our days. Our <em>lives</em>. When I started on this journey
    I told myself I would finish high school and that by the time I had finished I would go to college or univeristy and know
    exactly what I want to do with my life.
    <strong>How can a person know what they want to do by doing exacly what they're told to do, even if they don't enjoy it?</strong>
    Is that how we should spend our lives? Bending to the conventional track we are <em>expected</em> to follow?</p>
  <p>I am emplyed at the <i>Ancien Stand Amavita Pharmacy</i> as a pharmacy technician and assistant.
    My job consists of filling prescriptions for clients. I make their ointments, solutions, suppositories, capsules and more.
    But that's not how I intend spending my life. Ever since I finished my </em>CFC</em>, I've been <strong> <em>craving</em> for learning</strong>.
    I have kept a steady pace of learning and exploring different fields that can be taught to a person. First I started and
    finished a nail technician certificate. Then I finished an online L2 Fitness Instructor certificate, and <em>now</em>, I've
    started this web and app developpement course. This is surely not where my learning streek will end and with every bit
    of progress I make, I'll be sure to update. </p> </center>
